Netflix War Movies Data Analysis - Code Explanation

1. Duration and Retention Analysis - Part 1
--------------------------------------------
- We load the Netflix war movies dataset using Pandas.
- The duration column, assumed to be in the format '123 min', is converted to an integer representing the duration in minutes.
- A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between movie duration and user retention percentage.
- We calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the linear correlation between duration and retention.

2. Testing Algorithms and Methods - Part 1
--------------------------------------------
- We use an independent t-test to compare the mean user retention between short movies (less than 120 minutes) and long movies (120 minutes or longer).
- The t-test helps us understand if the difference in mean retention rates between these two groups is statistically significant.

Further Analysis (Not included in the notebook but discussed earlier)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Additional methods such as linear regression, duration binning, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests were also discussed to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
- These methods would further explore the relationship between movie duration and user retention and validate findings using different statistical approaches.

Note: The actual implementation of these analyses depends on the specific structure and characteristics of the dataset being used.
