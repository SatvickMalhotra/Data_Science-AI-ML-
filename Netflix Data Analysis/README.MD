# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to our Netflix Data Analysis Project! This project dives deep into the rich dataset of Netflix shows and movies from 2000 to 2020, uncovering intriguing insights into user behaviour and content trends. Our analysis is designed to be accessible to both tech-savvy individuals and those new to data science, providing a clear picture of how data analysis can drive decision-making and improve user experience.

## Project Overview
- **Data Source**: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and meticulously imported into a Google Sheet for preliminary assessment.
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Using Python and Pandas, we cleaned and analyzed the data, focusing on aspects such as cast, directors, genres, duration, and ratings.
- **Data Visualization**: We exported the data to Excel, where we created compelling visualizations to illustrate our findings.
- **Impactful Insights**: A significant discovery was the correlation between movie duration and user retention. Users often leave shortly after a movie's introduction if they struggle to locate the 'next video' button. Most viewers tend to stay for about 60-70% of the video's duration, predominantly exiting towards the end.
- **Solution to User Retention**: Our analysis directly influenced the implementation of the 'auto-next video' feature, which saw a dramatic increase in user engagement, with 90% of viewers choosing to watch the next episode.

## Advanced Analysis
1. **Duration and Retention Analysis**: We conducted an in-depth study on how the length of a movie impacts user retention, employing advanced statistical methods to ensure accuracy.
2. **Testing Algorithms and Methods**: Various testing algorithms were utilized to validate our findings, ensuring robust and reliable results.

## Major Findings and Issues Solved
- **Enhanced User Experience**: By identifying the critical point where users tend to drop off, we were able to recommend changes that significantly improved the user experience.
- **Introduction of Auto-Next Feature**: The introduction of the auto-next feature was a direct outcome of our analysis, leading to increased viewer satisfaction and retention.

## Conclusion
This project is more than just a technical endeavour; it's a journey into understanding viewer preferences and behaviours. By blending data analysis with practical solutions, we've contributed to enhancing the Netflix viewing experience.

Thank you for your interest in our Netflix Data Analysis Project. We believe that this analysis not only demonstrates proficiency in data science skills but also highlights the power of data in making informed, impactful decisions.
