Selenium Web Scraping for Report Generation
Overview
This Python script automates the process of logging into a web-based reporting system, setting date ranges, running reports, and scraping the resulting data into a CSV file. It's designed to handle cases where data needs to be gathered in chunks over a period, due to limitations on the amount of data that can be processed at one time.

How It Works
The script performs the following steps:

Initial Setup: It imports necessary Python libraries and defines a function to calculate future dates based on a given interval.

WebDriver Initialization: It sets up the Chrome WebDriver, which will control the Chrome browser.

Login Automation: The script navigates to the login page, enters the username and password into the form, and submits the form to log into the reporting system.

Date Range Input: For each interval within the total period (e.g., every 4 days within 80 days), it inputs the start and end dates into the report parameters.

Option Selection: It selects the 'Clinic Only' option based on the provided criteria.

Report Generation: It triggers the report generation by clicking the 'Run report' button.

Data Scraping: Once the report is generated, the script scrapes the table data using BeautifulSoup and stores it in a pandas DataFrame.

Data Aggregation: After collecting data from each interval, it concatenates all individual DataFrames into one.

Saving Data: The final aggregated data frame is saved as a CSV file to a specified location.

Clean Exit: The browser is closed, and the WebDriver session is ended gracefully.

Features and Libraries Used
Selenium: Automates web browser interaction from Python.
BeautifulSoup: Parses HTML and XML documents and extracts data.
Pandas: Provides data structures and data analysis tools.
DateTime: Supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.
Time: Allows for a delay in the script execution, which is useful for waiting for pages to load.
Requirements
Chrome Browser installed on the machine.
ChromeDriver is compatible with the installed Chrome version.
Python libraries: selenium, pandas, beautifulsoup4, datetime.
Usage
To use this script, update the placeholders with your actual ChromeDriver path, login URL, username, and password. Set the initial_start_date, days_to_add, and total_intervals as per the requirements. Run the script in a Python environment with all necessary libraries installed.

Notes
The script may require adjustments based on the web page's specific structure and behaviour.
Make sure to follow best practices for handling passwords and sensitive data, especially when pushing code to public repositories.
The script's performance and reliability can vary based on network conditions and the responsiveness of the web application.
