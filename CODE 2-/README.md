# Large CSV File Processor 🔄

## Overview 🌐
This Python script is designed to efficiently handle and process large CSV files by reading them in manageable chunks. It is particularly useful for datasets too large to be loaded into memory all at once.

## Features 🌟
- **Chunk Processing:** Breaks down large CSV files into smaller, digestible chunks for efficient processing.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows users to specify the separator and encoding as per their dataset requirements.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully skips bad lines and handles encoding errors.

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install `pandas` if not already installed:
