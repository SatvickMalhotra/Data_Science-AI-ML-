# Advanced Clinic Location Analyzer with Interactive Map 🗺️🏥

## Overview 🌐
This Python script is an advanced tool for visualizing and analyzing clinic locations across India. Building upon the basic mapping functionalities, it introduces clinic clusters, heatmaps, and filtering options to provide a more in-depth analysis of clinic distribution and metrics.

## Features 🌟
- **Interactive Map with Clinic Clusters**: Clusters clinic locations for better visualization and management of densely populated areas.
- **Heatmaps for Consultations and Policies**: Visualizes intensity of consultations and policy coverage using heatmaps.
- **Filtering Options**: Enhanced dropdowns with search functionality to select and analyze specific clinic locations.
- **Highlight Selected Clinics**: Highlight chosen clinics for comparison and analysis.

## How It Works 🔍
- **Heatmaps**: Two separate heatmaps show the distribution of consultations and policies across clinics.
- **Clinic Clusters**: Groups nearby clinics into clusters to manage densely populated areas on the map.
- **Interactive Selection and Filtering**: Users can filter and select clinics using enhanced dropdowns, facilitating easier location analysis.
- **Distance Analysis**: The script retains the ability to calculate and display distances between selected clinics.

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x
- folium (`pip install folium`)
- ipywidgets (`pip install ipywidgets`)
- geopy (`pip install geopy`)
- IPython (`pip install ipython`)
