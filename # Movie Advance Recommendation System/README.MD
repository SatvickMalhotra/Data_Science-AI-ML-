# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the code for a movie recommendation system that uses content-based filtering. The system analyzes movie metadata, including genres, keywords, and overviews, to recommend movies similar to a given title and description.

## Overview

The recommendation system operates on the principle of content-based filtering. It leverages a combination of movie metadata - genres, keywords, and overviews - to find movies with similar content. The system employs TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction and Cosine Similarity for measuring the similarity between movies.

## Features

- Combines movie genres, keywords, and overviews to create a rich feature set.
- Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into a numerical format.
- Employs Cosine Similarity to identify movies with similar content.
- Provides personalized movie recommendations.

##Usage
#Follow these steps to utilize the movie recommendation system:

- Load your movie dataset.
- Preprocess the data to combine genres, keywords, and overviews.
- Use TF-IDF Vectorization to transform the text data.
- Calculate Cosine Similarity between movies.
- obtain recommendations based on a given title and description.

##Example
#To get movie recommendations similar to "Toy Story" with a focus on friendship and adventure, use the following code:
-recommended_movies = get_recommendations('Toy Story', 'A story about friendship and adventure') 
-print(recommended_movies)
